PhD in neuroscience for research done at Max Planck Institute; extensive research and teaching experience; Germany, Norway mainly. Residing in Norway.

Blocked today basically from every place offline and online that Norway can control somehow.
It began when I spoke up about the discrimination of foreign researchers in Norway.
Norway took from me my carrier, my network, my money, and most future possibilities. Before that I was not aware of such being a possibility today.

Currently, I try to sell some silly shirts and help senior citizens using IT.
