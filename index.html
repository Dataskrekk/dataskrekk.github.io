PhD in neuroscience for research done at Max Planck Institute; extensive research and teaching experience; Germany, Norway mainly.<br>
Residing in Norway.
</p>

<p>
Blocked today basically from every regular place offline and online.<br>
This began when I spoke up about the discrimination of foreign researchers in Norway. Instead of the Norwegian authorities looking into the issue, they rather took from me my carrier, my network, my money, and most future possibilities.<br>
Before that I was not even aware of such being a possibility today in a western country.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I try to sell some silly shirts and help senior citizens using IT.
