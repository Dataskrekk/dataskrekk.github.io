<h3>About Gabriele:</h3>

<p>
PhD in neuroscience for research done at Max Planck Institute; extensive research (neurophysiology) and teaching experience (from Germany, Norway mainly).<br>
Residing in Norway.
</p>

<p>
Excluded today from basically any regular place offline and online.<br>
This is so because I spoke up about the discrimination of foreign researchers in Norway. Instead of the responsible authorities looking into the issue, they rather took from me my career, network, money, and most future possibilities using disgusting methods.<br>
Before that I was not even aware of such being a possibility today in a western country.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I try to sell silly 
<a href="https://www.teepublic.com/user/dataskrekk">shirts</a>
 and give free IT support to senior citizens.
I am available for any reasonable job (jeg snakker flytende norsk, og jeg har dokumentert kompetanse i bruk av norsk i jobbsammenheng).
</p>
<p>
I always used to give of my own money to all sorts of people. Beggars, colleagues scammed out of salary, even to liars posing as refugees. Would I have kept it, I now could use it myself and eat healthy food.
